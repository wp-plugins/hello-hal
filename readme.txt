== Description ==

Based on the famous "Hello Dolly" plugin, "Hello HAL" ( Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic Computer: HAL 9000 ) is a science fiction movie quotation plugin developed for the WAD 9000 ( Wordpress ADministration Panel ). It was decided that simply having the quotes wasn't nearly as entertaining as including the author's name and title of the movie and so directly under the quote is a small caption with this information. 
 
== Installation ==

To install the plugin just follow these simple steps:

1. Download the plugin and expand it.
2. Copy the 'Hello HAL' folder into your plugins folder (wp-content/plugins/).
3. Login into the WordPress administration area and go to the Plugins page.
4. Locate the Hello HAL plugin and click on the activate link.
5. That's it, look in the Admin Navigation bar for the quotes.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work properly? =

Hopefully, assuming "Hello Dolly" doesn't have any issues this should be fine. If HAL is broken we can blame the author of Dolly :)

= Are you taking quotes for the next version? =

Yes, as long as you have: The name of the person who spoke the line ( movie names only ) and the title of the movie. I will be happy to include them at intervals of thirty and update this plugin. 

Good:

Bad:
"I was just remembering the last time we had a quiet drink together. I had a milkshake."
[ Harrison Ford: Indiana Jones Movie ]

= Have you tested this plugin in other Wordpress versions? =

No, have you tried "Hello Dolly" in any other versions? Let me know if it works. This is strictly for fun and as such I have no intentions of testing this out. If it doesn't work, I'm sorry.
