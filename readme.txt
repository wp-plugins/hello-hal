== Description ==

Based on the now famous "Hello Dolly" plugin created by Matt Mullenweg, "Hello HAL" ( Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic Computer: HAL 9000 ) is a science fiction movie quotation plugin displaying random quotes within the dashboard. The goal was to take the Hello Dolly plugin a step or two further by including the speaking character's name and the title of the film.
